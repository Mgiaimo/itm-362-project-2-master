# itm-362-project-2-master

self-critique: Working on this project i can see why web design is more then just the code you write. There is so much more. You have to know how users interact with a website. And if your design is not good they will leave it. I feel as though my web design skills are getting much better but at this point in this class i am having trouble with the design aspects of it. I am not a creative person so the design aspect would not be something for me. I am also still having trouble coding for a mobile friendly design.


Group Member Critiques

	Vince Giaimo: Vince helped me out a lot in building this redesign website of iit. He had fixed all the errors of the logout page. He created the registration form and also did a lot of the CSS. He also helped with the pull requests to github.

	Junhua Dong: He was the master of the group projects repo. he would deal with all the errors/ troubles of the pull request to the master repo. Dong created the login page for our website and integrated the banner also. Dong made sure that we turned it our assignments on time and would also post the groups work to basecamp

	 Feng Li: Not sure if he contributed at all to this project from what i can tell in his own persoanl repo there was only 7 commits and i never heard from him at all besides one time. Will not work this team member again.

	 Andy Dimnych: Andy did not contribute at all to this project. In his personal repo for the project folder he only has had 8 commits and that was 28 days ago. will never work with this person again as he was completely useless.
